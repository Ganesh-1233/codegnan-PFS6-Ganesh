	<p class="intro">There are many variations of the vegetarian diet: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy productsan ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. As the strictest of vegetarian diets, a vegan diet excludes all animal products, and can be accompanied by abstention from the use of animal-derived products, such as leather shoes.Vegetarian diets pose some difficulties. For vitamin B12, depending on the presence or absence of eggs and dairy products in the diet or other reliable B12 sources, vegetarians may incur a nutritional deficiency. Packaged and processed foods may contain minor quantities of animal ingredients.While some vegetarians scrutinize product labels for such ingredients.</p><br>
<p>others do not object to consuming them</p><br>
<p>or are unaware of their presence.</p>
